# Code Generator
Overview
--------
This Code Generator is a desktop application designed to streamline the creation of data access and business logic layers, App.Config, along with SQL stored procedures. This tool simplifies development workflows by automating the generation of repetitive boilerplate code, significantly reducing the time and effort required from developers. Its user-friendly configuration options allow for customization based on specific project needs.

Automatically generate data access components using ADO.NET with stored procedures, and create C# classes for business logic, all while supporting Microsoft SQL Server databases. The future plans involve expanding support to other technologies.
